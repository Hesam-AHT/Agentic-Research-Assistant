# RefHunters Frontend

React + Vite + TypeScript frontend for the RefHunters research assistant.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The frontend is a dual-pane React application featuring a chat interface and a PDF viewer.

### Key Routes
- `/` → **UploadPage**: PDF upload and expertise selection.
- `/answer` → **AnswerPage**: Interactive Q&A with live PDF highlighting.
- `/test-highlight` → **PDFHighlightTest**: *Debugging tool for PDF section search (development only).*

## 🔄 User Flow

1.  **Upload**: User selects a PDF and their expertise level.
2.  **Query**: On the first question, the PDF is uploaded and a session is started.
3.  **Chat**: Users ask questions; backend returns answers with citations.
4.  **Interaction**: Clicking a citation `[1]` triggers the PDF viewer to search and highlight the relevant section.
